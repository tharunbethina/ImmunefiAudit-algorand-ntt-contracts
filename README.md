# algorand-ntt-contracts

## Overview

This repository contains the PuyaPy implementation for Wormhole NTT on Algorand.

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS
- Python 3
- AlgoKit

## Setup

To install all required packages, run:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
npm install
```

## Smart Contracts

The `contracts` folder contains the following:

- `contracts/external` contains the external smart contracts which are referenced but are not strictly part of the NTT implementation.
- `contracts/library` contains library smart contracts which are used. Some of these (like OpUp) are used for testing purposes.
- `contract/ntt_manager` contains the smart contracts relating to the NTT manager, the entry point for users to transfer and receive tokens between chains.
- `contract/ntt_token` contains the smart contracts which are used to make an ASA an NTT token.
- `contracts/transceiver` contains the smart contracts to send and receive messages between chains.

In addition, there are multiple `test` folders within the `contracts` folder which are used solely for unit testing. They should not be considered safe to use.

## Compilation

To generate the TEAL code, ARC56 specs and TS clients for the contracts, run the command:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Testing

Start an Algorand localnet with AlgoKit and Docker using:

```bash
algokit localnet start
```

Make sure to run the compilation commands before testing.

Run all tests from root directory using:

```bash
npm run test
```

or single test file using:

```bash
PYTHONPATH="./contracts" npx jest <PATH_TO_TEST_FILE>
```

It is not possible to run the tests in parallel so `--runInBand` option is passed.
